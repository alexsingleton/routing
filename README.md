This is the repository for the code used to create a school commuting emissions model featured in this paper: 

[Singleton, A. (2013) A GIS Approach to Modelling CO_2 Emissions Associated with the Pupil-School Commute. International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 28(2):256â€“273.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2013.832765)

In addition to [R](http://www.r-project.org/), the [Routino](http://www.routino.org/) library is also required. 

This work was created as part of ESRC grant ES/K007459/1.

A basic example of using R with Routino can be found [here](http://rpubs.com/alexsingleton/routino).
